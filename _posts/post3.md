# Home sweet home

The next most important thing for my new homebase, is, well, the homepage. Below is the tale of how it came to be.

## Wants vs Needs

My current homepage is housed in a humble repo that is using nothing more than parcel, vanilla markup, and vanilla css.

I made it over a weekend.

I wanted something lean. Something minimal.

I also _wanted_ to use an SVG logo, but Parcel was having a hell of a time with it.
I _wanted_ to write all the words as markdown and convert it so that I could manage that set of data separate from the rest.
I _wanted_ to have a really simple admin UI to manage the links at the bottom of the page. I _wanted_ to convert the design into a UI kit in Sketch so I could build out the other pages in a cohesive style.

Despite my penchant for getting distractible and over indexing on things that are of deep interest to me, but not to the final product, I was able to finish this.

Why?

Because I had just lost my job.

And I **_needed_** a new one.

And to do that, I **needed** a place to send people.

So, I wrote a draft of copy and a draft of styles, and published it.

I've tweaked it. A bit. Since then. But it has mostly worked.

And with that in mind, I'm not gonna touch this. Well, not in _spirit_.

I still want all those things above, or the new version of them.

I _want_ to convert it to Chakra.
I still _want_ the markdown and the mini-admin to manage my links.
I _want_ to re-write some of the copy.
And I _want_ to refactor the base styles so they are inline w/ the blog and rest of the site.

But i **NEED** a homepage for my new project.

So that's what I'm gonna do.

## What it look like

This is the site as it lives currently:

![Old homepage](/assets/blog/3/old-homepage.jpg)

This is the same page running in my local repo.

![New homepage](/assets/blog/3/new-homepage.jpg)

Can't tell the difference? Good.

This isn't the most exciting thing I could have done today. And writing these words about not changing a damn thing to my homepage while I spin up a whole new project feels _super dumb_. But I'm doing it. Codifying the practice of documenting these decisions and following through is a skill I need to cultivate.

Here's to a new year of little steps like this.

It will all add up in the end. Right?
